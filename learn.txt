I believe DevClub is the Software Development Club of IIT DELHI. Most other IIT's already have such clubs to promote tech enthusiasm among individuals but it seemed to be lacking in IIT Delhi. Keeping this in mind this club was founded by people. This club will help in creating a technological temperament among the members and will aid in their learning experience as they meet new people and in turn gain knowledge and most importantly their experiences.
